# ATmega32 Drivers Repository

This repository provides a set of drivers (software components) for the **ATmega32** microcontroller to interface with a variety of peripherals. The drivers are organized in a modular way to simplify embedded system development and offer reusable code for frequently used components.

## Overview

The repository is structured as follows:

- **MCAL (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer)**:  
  Contains low-level drivers for peripheral initialization and interaction with the microcontroller hardware.

- **HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)**:  
  Provides drivers for specific hardware components:
  - **CLCD (Character LCD)**: Used for text display on an LCD screen.
  - **LED**: Provides basic LED control functions, such as turning the LED on/off and blinking.
  - **Keypad**: Reads input from a matrix keypad.
  - **Switch**: Manages button input for user interaction.

- **LIB (Library)**:  
  Contains supporting files for:
  - **Bit Manipulation**: Utilities for performing bit-level operations.
  - **Platform-Specific Type Definitions**: Ensures portability of the code across different platforms.

## Purpose

These drivers are designed to:
- Provide easy-to-use, reusable code for working with common embedded system peripherals.
- Simplify the development process by offering abstracted layers (MCAL and HAL) to handle hardware interactions.
- Help developers focus on higher-level application logic without worrying about low-level peripheral handling.

## Features

- **Modular**: Each driver is self-contained, allowing you to easily add or remove components based on your project's needs.
- **Reusable**: Drivers can be reused across different projects for consistent functionality.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple functions and clear documentation make it easy to integrate the drivers into any embedded project using the ATmega32.
